## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the LGBTQIA+ community. In particular, I hope to analyze public comments submitted in response to Governor Youngkin's attempts to change Department of Education guidelines towards transgender youth in Virginia. Over 60,000+ comments were submitted in response to the guidelines, but they have never been analyzed.
